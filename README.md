ABOUT PAGE
I tried to do this without using a separate css file since there's a ton of stuff you can do through bootstrap. All the styling on these pages are from one bootstrap class or another.

I wanted the backgrounds of the bodies to be on the darker side and for the actual spaces for content to be lighter so that they were mored focused on the content and less on the lack thereof. As there are more projects on these pages there should be fewer instances where there are huge swaths of blank space.

The points where I ran into the most issue were the most issue are with the images. The bottom images on the portfolio page are way smaller than the others for some reason. Even after I applied the img-responsive and img-thumbnail classes to it they never filled out. I was able to make everything else look neat with containers and placement but I don't know if there's a way to make the pictures larger. 

I also ran into issues with the sticky footer. I got it to work but it covers some of my content. I was tried adding padding to the bottom of the body element but there was never any change.

Other than that the pages should all be responsive and work on any device. I tried it on the computer by just changing the size of the window on my browser as well as a couple different phones.
